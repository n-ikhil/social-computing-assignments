#Social Computing CS522
#Programming Assignment #4
#(Submission Deadline: 15th October 2020)

#Note: The functions given in the assignment are entirely based on the video lectures related to Point Distribution Method for Implementing Page Rank. For further details you can refer the related videos.

#If there is any query related to assignment you should ask at least 48 hours before the deadline, no reply would be given in case you ask during the last 48 hours.
#Please avoid asking any syntax related queries, if you feel anything given can lead to an error, you may change it but make sure the desired output does not change.

##Kindly note your output values may vary due to randomness.
##You may use other functions but make sure I would be directly running your .py file on terminal and no marks will be provided for any kind of errors.
## Kindly do not add any additional print statements other than given in the code.
'''
Important Notes: 
1)Your file should be named as scomp_asg04_<Your entry number>.py. For example if your entry number is 2014csz0001, your file name should be scomp_asg04_2014csz0001.py. (use only small letters)
2) Make sure you do not copy the code neither from internet nor from any other student.
3) Strictly follow the guidelines given regarding the unimplemented functions and use only Python3.
4) No marks will be given in case of syntactical errors, logical errors of any kind.
5) Your .py file will be executed directly on the command prompt or terminal, so do take care of that.
